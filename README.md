#### Features 6:

- Change the event endpoint, so it supports adding a parameter page number. returns 10 events per page, but it can also return more per page if you pass the parameter paginate_by()
- Change the models so you have two new classes that are called online event and physical event, they both inherit from the event class but the online event has a new attribute url and the physical event has a new attribute called location
- Remove the category type from the category model and just keep categories in the event model
- Create the migration, it should migrate the data, if the event has at least one physical event then it should be a physical event, otherwise it is an online event

    - Address
    - City
